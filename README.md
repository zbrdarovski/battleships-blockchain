# Battleships Blockchain

This is a 2D board game for 2 players. Players try to sink enemy's ships by choosing a location on the boeard where they think the ships are located. The game ends when one of the players correctly guesses all enemy ships' locations. The winner receives score points. A leaderboard shows the players' accumulated scores. The score points are translated to shop points. The player can use shop points to purchase ship skins in the ingame store. The transcations are recorded on a blockchain.

> Notice: The shop points are a separate variable. They are not the same as the total accumulated score.

Through settings players are able to adjust sounds and music.
